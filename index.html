<h1> Music For the Moving Image Compositions</h1>
<h2> Assignment 1 - Poem 3 
<p> The basis of this composition is drone music, best listened to through headphones or speakers. I have looked to artists that are considered the pioneers of minimalism, those such as Steve Reich, Phillip Glass, La Monte Young and Arvo Pärt. Drone music is considered a sub-genre of minimalism and unlike traditional minimalist music such as the works of Phillip Glass (which uses sustain and prolongation in the form of many repeated notes). Drone music emphasizes the use of single sustained notes either in polyphonic textures or monphonic on occasion i.e tone clusters. I was also fascinated by the effect I knew slight differentiation in tone would have on the physical world, not just sonically, but its actual effect on the human body. A concept I discovered in my lectures with the Ensemble For The Moving Image. I learnt that when notes sustained are a semitone apart, the dissonance seems to create a sort of pulse in the air that can be affected by interacting with it as a physical prescence. I wanted to recreated this effect with synthesisers and have resulted in this piece. The effects relation to the poem bears great significance, the way the music sounds when listened to in a binaural space (headphones, or multiple placed speakers), makes the listener feel as though they are encompassed by the sound, much as they would be encompassed by water or earth or the emptiness of space. All of which are heavily implied or outrightly stated in the poem. There are subtle samples of screams in this piece, lowered in pitch to match the pulse, but is a reference to the line "Gaia's broken throat".</p>

<h2> Assignment 2 - Dance of Light, Rhea Quien
<p> 
In this task, I have taken inspiration from Yoko Ono’s work ‘Fly’, a work she recorded during her involvement in the Fluxus movement. The song comes from her album ‘Fly’ and is a 20 minute work consisting of Ono exploring the extend of pitch, texture and timbre in her voice by making noises, notes and other vocalisations outside of any structural ‘song’ form. 

I was intrigued by her exploration of her own voice and decided that it would be interesting to use my voice as the instrument with which I would create the entire structure and abstract melody of the ‘Dance of Light’ film. I decided pairing and abstract musical idea and an abstract film that relates itself to a condition that is fundamentally a reaction to sensory stimuli (synaesthesia), would be appropriate. The fact that synaesthesia, though an often rare condition (if you might even class it as something so medical) is still a very raw human reaction meant that I felt as though a musical reaction using non-biological instruments (such as a guitar or violin as opposed to the voice or body percussion) would somehow diminish the human element of the film. So, with ‘Fly’ in mind I decided use my voice and my voice alone to create the entire composition.

Not only have I created pitched sounds and maqam melodies with my voice. But also using other parts of my mouth to create sound i.e whistling, tongue clicking, breathing, blowing air, buzzing my lips and other more difficult to describe sounds.</p>

<h2> Assignment 3 - Erased, Solomia Dzhurovska
<p> 
As in the previous work, I have used influences from what one might consider; world music. Though in the last work, I used maqaams and prayer song influence from arabic countries and the Islamic faith. In this composition I have looked to the music of Klezmer and specifically the improvised solo known as a ‘doina’. The similarities between this piece and the last are that I have used only one instrument, the violin. All the sounds in the piece are made on the violin, I have utilised several extended techniques such a col legno battuto , jete, glissando  and harmonics as well as more traditional techniques such as tremolo and double stopping. All the parts are layered with various amounts of reverb of different types, this gives the backdrop of the improvised melody an ethereal, drone like texture which I think suits the dark theme. I might point out, that my own interpretation of this film is that of greek mythology. The story seems to me an interpretation of the story of narcissus, whom found his own reflection so beautiful that he stayed there fixated, unable to move. Imagine at this time, the music to be that resembling turkish/arabic music and there for found these scales and the very nature of musical improvisation to be appropriate.</p>
